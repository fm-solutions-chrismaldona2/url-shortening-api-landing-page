# URL Shortening API Landing Page

This is an interactive landing page built with React that allows users to shorten URLs.
The app is the solution to the [URL Shortening API Landing Page challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/url-shortening-api-landing-page-2ce3ob-G) on Frontend Mentor.

## Important Update

During the development of this app, the API originally provided in the challenge was replaced due to CORS errors. To ensure proper functionality, the [Spoo.me API](https://spoo.me/api) was used instead. This API offers reliable URL shortening services, allowing the app to generate compact and shareable links effectively.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **localStorage**: Used to store and display previously seen advice in the app.
- **Motion**: Library for creating smooth animations and transitions.
- **React Hook Form**: A library for managing form state and validation in a simple and efficient way.
- **[Spoo.me API](https://spoo.me/api)**: Public API providing URL shortening services, enabling the app to generate compact and shareable links.
